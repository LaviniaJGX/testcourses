# Assignment 1 - API testing and Source Control.

Name: GUIXIN JIANG
Student ID: 20082268

## Overview.
...... A statement of the API's context and objectives (just a paragraph)........

This is a course arrangement system to find the accurate courses,teachers and students information.
There are three models: courses , teacher , student
"courses" has 6 attributes: courseTitle , classHours , studentNumbers , studentCategory , teacherName , teacherType
    In this route,we can get all courses/course by ID/all student numbers/all course hours/course by keyword
                         add a course
			 change hours/student numbers in a course
			 delete a course
"teacher" has 5 attributes: name , teacherType , teacherGender , department , departmentMajor
    In this route,we can get all teachers/teacher by ID/teacher by name/teacher by keyword
                         add a teacher
			 change department/major about a teacher
			 delete a teacher
"student" has 4 attributes: name , studentCategory , coursesNumbers , major
    In this route,we can get all students/studnt by ID/student by name/student by keyword
                         add a student
			 change category/major about a student
			 delete a student

## Data storage.
. . . . This section is only relevant if your tests included the integration of MongoDB (or other database) with the API. It should specify the database schema, i.e. JSON document structure for each collection type in the MongoDB database.

I connect using a driver via the standard MongoDB URI
    mongodb://LaviniaJGX:dreammj01@ds151453.mlab.com:51453/testcourses
    The address is https://mlab.com/databases/testcourses , user: LaviniaJGX , password: dreammj01
    The database is testcourses , there are three collections: courses , teacher , student

Collection: courses

## Extra features.
. . . . Briefly state any extra features of your testing that you feel should be high-lighted . . . . .

I have done these in my test shown as below:
1. Git -  log shows coherent, sustained progress ; Use gitignore policy.
2. Testing – 3 REST resources (3 test files); Clear test cases (it block specifications); Before/After hooks; Some exception testing.
3. Git – Branch-Edit-Merge workflow; 
4. Commit ‘work units’; 
   $F:\Agile Software Practice\coursestest>git rebase -i af9dfe77c98512fe37cdf931d91b0c96cbe98099
     [detached HEAD 7195e0e] courses-testing
     Date: Tue Nov 6 10:06:30 2018 +0800
     2 files changed, 51 insertions(+), 33 deletions(-)
     Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.
   $
5. Rollback;
   When I tested teacher-test, I found somgthing wrong, then I use git-reset to return to the latest correct commit.
   Also , I commit "test rollback" ,then: 
     $ git revert d762695a187e2507517eea55ab560dfe6403b299 , we can get that: 
     $ d0db710 (HEAD -> master) HEAD@{0}: revert: Revert "test rollback"
   To revert all the local actions from 70a3692d38ebaa0f2 up to “HEAD,” use the following:
     $ git revert d762695a187e2507517eea55ab560dfe6403b299 HEAD
   After checking out the remote repository, we can first use git revert and then push as usual:
     $ git revert d762695a187e2507517eea55ab560dfe6403b299
       git push origin
6. Testing – Test code structure (nested describe blocks); 
7. Database integration;
   To connect the database to the Express application, simply load the appropriate Node. JS driver for the database in the application.
      var mongodbUri ='mongodb://test:dreammj01@ds151453.mlab.com:51453/testcourses';
      mongoose.connect(mongodbUri,{ useNewUrlParser: true });
8. Git –  Excellent practice;
   git init , git status , git add , git commit -m , git log , git push , git log -p , git diff , git diff HEAD , git branch , git checkout -b , git pull 
   git checkout , git checkout - , git checkout master , git marge , git log --graph , git reset , git reset --hrash , git reflog , git rebase -i
9. Exception and (meaningful) Boundary cases;
   For the model "courses",there are two arrtibutes 
       classHours at the interval of[20,42] ,  studentNumbers at the interval of[25,60]
   The boundary cases are:
       <33,25> , <33,26> , <33,24> , <33,59> , <33,60> , <33,61> , <19,18> , <20,18> , <21,18> , <41,18> , <42,18> , <43,18> 
10. Testing – Authentication;
   You can find these at : GET /courses/:id
                          PUT /coursesCertain/:id/:teacherName/CHour
			  PUT /coursesCerNum/:id/:teacherName/CNum
			  PUT /courses/:id/:teacherName/Teacher
